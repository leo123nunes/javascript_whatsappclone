Welcome to the WhatsApp clone project.

After clone the project, enter "npm i" to download the dependencies.
Enter "npm run build" to build the project with Webpack.
Enter "npm start" to run the app on port 8080 (localhost:8080).

Enjoy :)

p.s. The project is not completed. I used a already made whatsapp template in the project.
