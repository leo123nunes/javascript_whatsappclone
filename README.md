Welcome to the WhatsApp clone project.

After clone the project, enter "npm i" to download the dependencies.
Enter "npm run build" to build the project with Webpack.
Enter "npm start" to run the app on port 8080 (localhost:8080).

Enjoy :)

p.s. The project is not completed.
p.s. I'm working with 2 branches, the first one 'master' i'm making the project starting from empty template html and css, building all the page from the 0 and starting with webpack. The second one 'whatsapp-2', i started the project with a template html and css already made without webpack.
